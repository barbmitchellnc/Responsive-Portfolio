            <img src="Assets\images\barb.png" alt="Barb" id="bio-image">
            <p>I'm excited to be in this class. I started out as an Industrial engineer supporting production plants. I rose into management and I helped close 12 of those plants while reporting to the Chief Operating Officer of the company.
                <br>
                <br> When I had my son, I decided to make a change. I own a business that works with high IQ kids with learning disabilities. I have 2 kids and a twin sister in town - I'm sitting next to her husband in this class. My career path has had some twists and turns but I believe that makes life even more interesting.</p>
